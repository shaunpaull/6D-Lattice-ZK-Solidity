# 6D-Lattice-ZK-Solidity
Here's an example implementation of the challenge-response protocol as a Solidity contract for a zero-knowledge proof


This Solidity contract ZeroKnowledgeProof provides the same functionality as the C++ implementation I shared earlier. It includes the encryption and decryption functions, as well as the challenge and response functions.

The contract stores the lattice as an array of DAGNode structs, which represent the nodes in the lattice. The DAGNode struct contains the width, height, depth, time, energy, and spirit values.

The encryptMessageWithDiffusion function encrypts a message using the lattice values, while the decryptMessageWithDiffusion function decrypts the encrypted message.

The response function takes a challenge text, encrypts it using the lattice, and returns the encrypted response. The challenge function takes a ciphertext, decrypts it, and returns the decrypted message.

The contract also includes utility functions such as xorWithKey, generateRandomKey, stringToUnicode, and unicodeToString to assist in the encryption, decryption, and conversion between strings and Unicode values.
